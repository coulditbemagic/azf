repetition in bootstrap col-xx classes is not needed for bigger viewport sizes http://prntscr.com/cuv0uu

According to bootstrap docs: "Grid classes apply to devices with screen widths greater than or equal to the breakpoint sizes, and override grid classes targeted at smaller devices. Therefore, e.g. applying any .col-md-* class to an element will not only affect its styling on medium devices but also on large devices if a .col-lg-* class is not present."
